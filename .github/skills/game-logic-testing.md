# Skill: Game Logic Testing

Use this for model/state changes.

## Goal
Ensure scoring, streak, board generation, and state transitions are deterministic and validated without SwiftUI.

## Steps
1. Modify `Dictive/DictiveGame.swift`.
2. Add/update assertions in `Tests/TapGameSmokeTests.swift`.
3. Run `scripts/test.sh`.
4. If tests pass, run full `xcodebuild` app build.
5. Report all changed assertions and why.
